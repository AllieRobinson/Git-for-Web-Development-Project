# Git-Flow-Practice

This project is designed for one to practice the Git/Github workflow here at Lambda School. You will be able to follow along with [this pre-class video](https://youtu.be/4fLr6ah82bE) and use this assignment to demonstrate your ability to work within this flow. Watch this video, then follow the instructions listed below to complete the assignment

## Directions to complete this assignment

# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.

This project consists of two parts:

## Part One:
You will need to follow the Lambda School Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:


- [ ] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [ ] Add your PM as a collaborator
- [ ] Clone this repo
- [ ] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`

  - [ ] Add your name to the list of names below.
  - [ ] Run your usual git commands or adding/commiting and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch**
=======
  - [ ] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This file can contain anything.
  - [ ] Run your usual git commands for adding/commiting and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**

- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
  - [ ] Add your PM as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
- [ ] PM then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into master "STUDENT FORK".

## ADD your name here

- Steve Rogers
- Ryan Hamblin
- Catherine 'Allie' Robinson! 
=======
## Part Two:
Go back and follow the same steps for your [UI-III-Flexbox project](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/UI-III-Flexbox) and your [User Interface - Great Idea Project](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/User-Interface).

In order to do this, you **do not** need to create new forks of these projects. Follow the steps below for each project:

- [ ] Add your PM as a collaborator to your fork. 
- [ ] Go into your project folder, make a new branch `firstname-lastname`
- [ ] Add your first and last name to the README.md file in the project and save.
- [ ] add/commit/and push to your own branch  **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
  - [ ] Add your PM as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
- [ ] PM then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into master "STUDENT FORK".

## Stretch
- [ ] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independantly research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [ ] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
  - [ ] Reseach the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.
  - [ ] Reseach the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and ammends previous commits you have made.

- [ ] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 

- [ ] Research and setup SSH keys with Github, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
